Introduction
</div>
<p>
A Proof is often described as a poem. This originally indicates the cunningness and artistic interactions it often takes to find ways to prove whatever we want to prove.
Sadly, we often see proofs written as a poem, be it literally. Vague descriptions of why a certain property is what it is, not seldomly surrounded with intimidations, questioning the 
intelligence of the reader, are no exception. A complete proof based on axioms only without any shortcuts can rarely be found. These shortcuts hide a lot of assumptions. We often think these assumptions
 don't hide anything relevant... This kind of proof technique is sometimes used to prove such things as 1 = -1 and other invalid proofs.
</p>
<p>
If anything, these proofs are a warning, that if we're not careful we may be proving something false.
So if poems aren't the way to prove something, what is?

Formal proof
</div>
<p>
A formal proof, in this context, is to start from a formula or a set of formulas and prove the goal using these formulas and axioms only.
Let there be no doubt, this is not an easy task.
</p>

How we do a formal proof here
</div>
<p>
You start out by defining the axiomset you want to use.<br>
What is to be proven we shall now call the goal.
You start from no or several formulas that are true.
Based on this you can now use axioms from the axiomset to get to the goal.
<BR>
We apply the formulas of the axioms to the current formula, this is then transformed to a new formula.
After a chain of axioms applied to the current formula we transform it to become the goal.

How to protect against cheating
</div>
<p>
It is important to protect against cheating against the axiomatic assumptions, so it is impossible to prove something that isn't true.(The assumptions must be true.)
You start from a formula or multiple formulas that are true.
Axioms will always create a new formula that is true.
By not allowing the user to add a formula or only under very strict conditions it is impossible make a false proof.
The problem is that the axioms must therefore only generate a proof that is true. If one of the assumptions in the axioms is wrong we can prove that true is false and therefore we can prove
anything.

An example proof
</div>
<p>
Lets prove that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²<br>
<br>
For clarity and disambiguity all functions will be prefix.
<br><br>
<pre>
reflexiveEquation( ²(+(a , b) ) ) 							#this gives (a + b)² = (a + b)²
²def (rightside of =) 									#(a + b)² = product((a + b),(a + b))
²distributive sum (rightside of =, select product, always multiply with left side) 	#(a + b)² = product(a, (a + b)) + product(b, (a + b)) 
²distributive sum (rightside of =, select product, always multiply with left side)	#(a + b)² = product(a, a) + product(a, b)) + product(b, a) + product(a, b))
commutativity of product(product of b, a)						#(a + b)² = product(a, a) + product(a, b)) + product(a, b) + product(a, b))
count(product(a,b))									#(a + b)² = product(a, a) + product(2,product(a, b)) + product(a, b))
QED.											#(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
